#File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è: Create a program that reads a file and writes a modified version to a new file.
# Read from a file
#with open("practice.txt", "r") as file:
   # data = file.read()
   # print("Original Data:")
   # print(data)
# Modify the data
#modified_data = data.replace("old", "new")
# Write to a new file
#with open("modified_practice.txt", "w") as new_file:
   # new_file.write(modified_data)
    #print("Modified Data written to modified_practice.txt")




#Error Handling Lab üß™: Ask the user for a filename and handle errors if it doesn‚Äôt exist or can‚Äôt be read.
